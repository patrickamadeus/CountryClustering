# Country Clustering
This project is a part of the [Sanber Data Science Course](https://sanbercode.com/).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/patrickamadeus).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed - Further Improvement]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to cluster available countries based on multiple indicators using available Machine Learning Algorithm provided by [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Partner
* HELP International
* https://help-international.org/

### Methods Used
* IQR Outliers Method
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* K-Means Algorithm
* PCA

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* sklearn
* Matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Description
Using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) this project tend to cluster 167 countries based on multiple factors which listed below :
1. Child's Death
2. Export
3. Health
4. Import
5. Annual Incomes
6. Inflation Rate
7. Life Expectancy
8. Fertility Level
9. GDP Per Capita

The clusterization create a formation of scattermap that split data into *N* different parts optimally using K-Means algorithm combined with PCA techniques. This clusterization 
shows different level of quality of countries and have a functional use to create certain priority level for HELP Internatonal.

## Needs of this project
